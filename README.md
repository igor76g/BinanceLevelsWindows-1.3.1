# Binance Levels Monitor 1.3.1 (Windows)

Scans all Binance USDT-M perpetual futures (public endpoints only, no API keys) and warns when the price
comes close to a **cascade of levels**.

## Definitions
- **Extreme** - a swing high / swing low: a candle whose high (low) is the highest (lowest) among N candles on its
  left (default 3) and M candles on its right ("confirm", default 3). The shorter right side lets a fresh extreme
  (e.g. a bounce 15 minutes ago) join a cascade without waiting for N more candles. Default: 5m candles, 288 of them (24 h); both are configurable.
- **Cascade** - at least 2 extremes (configurable) of the same kind close to each other. Highs form a
  *resistance* cascade, lows a *support* cascade. 
- **Lines of a cascade** - every extreme is its own line. A cascade is a stack of lines. The signal is based on the
  NEAREST line that is still ahead of the price (support: the highest low below the price; resistance: the lowest high
  above it), not on the most distant one. The most extreme line (lowest low / highest high) decides if the cascade is broken.
- **Alive lines only.** Every extreme is a line, and a line is alive only if the price has NEVER gone beyond it since it
  formed - a wick counts, and so does a later extreme of the same cascade. Example: highs 100.0 and then 100.1 - the
  second high pierces the first line, so the 100.0 line is dropped (and the cascade disappears if no other line
  remains). Descending highs (110, 109.5, 109) never pierce each other and form a cascade. A small poke is tolerated:
  "Level is broken if a wick passes it by N avg candles" (0 = strictest; try 0.3-0.5 so that "equal highs" with a
  tiny difference still count as a cascade).
- **Tolerance** (how close extremes must be to form a cascade): by default **3 average 1-minute candles**, so it
  adapts to the volatility of the coin (limited to 0.05 %...2 %). Mode "percent" = fixed % (default 0.2 %).
- **Score 0-100** of a cascade: up to 50 for the number of extremes (5+ = full), up to 20 for how long the cascade
  has existed, up to 30 for the volume on the extreme candles vs the usual candle (3x+ = full).
  "Minimum cascade score" (default 0 = off) hides weak cascades everywhere.
- **Average 1-minute candle** - mean (high - low) of the 1-minute candles of the last hour.
- **Approach** - distance from the price to the cascade <= 1 average 1-minute candle (configurable).
- **Trend** - the distance now vs 3 minutes ago: *Closing*, *Moving away* or *Flat* (a change smaller than
  0.25 average candles is Flat). With "Do not notify when moving away" (default on) a coin that is moving away
  is not put into list 1 and gives no notification. It is still shown in list 2.

## Window
1. **Approaching a cascade** - new entries trigger sound + popup + Windows toast (with score and trend).
   Cooldown 30 min per coin and side (saved on disk).
2. **Closest to a cascade** - the 5 nearest coins, but not farther than 5 average candles (setting "'Closest' list: not farther than N avg candles", 0 = no limit). No notifications.

Columns: Ticker, Chart, Copy, Level price, Dist %, Dist (candles), Score, Extremes, 24h volume, Since.

Double-click a ticker -> opens it in Vataga.terminal. Every row has two cells right after the ticker:
**Chart** (chart of the coin) and **Copy** (copies the ticker). Right-click on a row also opens the chart.

### Chart
Shows the whole searched history (default 288 candles of 5m), including the candle that is still forming
(candles are loaded for the chart only, 1 request every 15 s). A cascade is drawn so that you can see what it is made of:
- every extreme is **its own plain line** that starts at that extreme and runs to the right edge;
- a small **circle** marks the extreme the line starts from;
- the **thick** line is the one the price is approaching (nearest ahead of it).
Label: `R`/`S` (resistance / support) and the price; the thick line also shows `x3` = extremes in the cascade and the score.

## Journal (button "Journal")
Every notification is recorded; 30 minutes later (configurable) its outcome is decided on 1-minute candles:
- **bounced** - the price reached the cascade and moved away from it by 2 average candles;
- **broke** - a candle closed beyond the cascade;
- **touched** - reached it, but neither bounced nor broke;
- **not_reached** - never got there.
Statistics per side and the bounce rate (bounced / (bounced + broke)) are shown; "Export to CSV" saves the list.
Use it to tune the settings (tolerance, minimum score, distance) instead of guessing.

## System tray
Settings > "Minimizing the window hides it to the system tray" (default on) and
"The X button hides the window to the tray instead of exiting" (default off). Monitoring continues in the tray;
the icon menu: Show window / Check now / Exit; the tooltip shows the status. Notifications and popups still appear.
(If the tray package is missing, the window is just minimized to the taskbar.)

## Settings (tabs)
Filters: 24h volume (30M USDT), NATR (0 = off), trades in the last 15 min (0 = off).
Cascades: candle size, history, swing strength, minimum extremes, tolerance, minimum score.
Approach: distance, trend, cooldown, check interval. Notifications and window: popups, tray, chart, journal.

## Vataga.terminal
Settings > General > "Application integration" on; link the window to the "Screener" group.
Partner id `BinanceLevelsMonitor`, port 5005 (Settings -> Test Vataga).

## Build
Upload the folder (including hidden `.github`) to GitHub -> Actions -> "Build Windows installer" ->
download `BinanceLevelsMonitor-Setup`. Or locally: `build.bat` (Python + Inno Setup 6).

## Traffic
REST only. Every check: 1 request for all tickers + a few new 1-minute candles per coin. Cascades are recalculated
every 5 minutes (1 request per coin with more than 30M volume, weight 2). The journal adds 1 small request per signal.

## Alerts log
The button "Alerts log" opens alerts.log. The file is emptied when the app is closed (Settings > "Empty the alerts log when the app is closed", default on). The journal is separate and is kept.

## Data
`%APPDATA%\BinanceLevelsMonitor\` : settings.json, alerts.log, alert_times.json, journal.json.

## Tests
`python -m unittest discover -s tests`

## Tips for tuning
- **Tolerance** decides which extremes form one cascade. In "candles" mode it follows the volatility of the coin; if highs
  that are visibly far apart get merged, lower "Tolerance in average 1-min candles" (try 0.3-0.5).
- **Extreme must beat N candles on its left** (default 3): large values (e.g. 10) keep only major swings.
- **Level is broken if a wick passes it by N avg candles**: 0 is the strictest.
